# CovidScraper-HU
It is a Python scraper (BeautifulSoup), which collects data from the official Hungarian COVID site.  It creates two xlsx files, which could be used for further analysis. I used PowerBI for the graphs, exported the charts as a PDF on 05.11. The data files are channeled to PowerBI so if the program runs, the charts update.
