# CovidScraper-HU


It is a Python scraper (BeautifulSoup), which collects data from the official Hungarian COVID site.  It creates two xlsx files, which could be used for further analysis. I used PowerBI for the graphs, exported the charts as a PDF on 07.01 (report_0701.pdf). The exported data files are channeled to PowerBI so if the program runs, the charts update automatically. In case of questions, ask: kenyeresrudolf@gmail.com

## Background

At the time of the creation of the project, the Hungarian governement was reluctant to provide usable statistics about COVID, the new daily infections, or the daily death toll. 

##  Problem & Solution 

The lack of analizable data erodes the trust of organisations, the government also the academic world. 
Without understanding the proper data, conspirational theories spread.  
My aim is to provide a solution, that collect and format the data and provides digestable charts about the COVID-related deaths in Hungary. 

##  How to use

Download the whole package -> 
Run the Python script -> 
Start the PowerBI file -> set up the created tables  as main sources.
